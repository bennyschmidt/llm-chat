# LLM Chat

A full stack application for an LLM chat server.

Includes the complete deploy-ready Node server and unbuilt React client.

Backend relies on [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) - self-host popular models like Mistral, Llama, and Gemma!

Front-end is a [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) - easily host on PaaS like Vercel, or build and deploy with your server!
